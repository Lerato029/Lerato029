### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, my name is Lerato Mokgwabona. 

I'm an entry level Front-End Web Developer and I enjoy solving problems, coding, design and art. I come from an Architectural background however, have been fascinated by the tech industry, the virtual platforms created to improve the way we live in reality. I love the freedom to create anything I can think of. So I took the opportunity to learn the skills to become a participant in the industry. I look forward to working along side UX and UI designers to create platforms that provide the best experience for the users and be a part of the community of developers who create platforms that connect people. See how to contact me ðŸ“« [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lerato-mokgwabona-97107a16b/).
